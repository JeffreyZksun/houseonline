#summary Describe the steps to deploy the system

= Steps =

 * Hardware preparation
    * Buy the hardwares listed in the [ShoppingList Shopping list]
    * Wiring the hardwares.
        * Stack Ethernet shield over the Arduino Board (Ethernet shield attached to pins 10, 11, 12, 13)
        * Connect the data pin of DHT11 to Arduino pin 2 (DHT11PIN)
        * Connect the SDA and SCL pins of AM2311 to 20 (SDA) and 21 (SCL) pins of Arduino
        * Connect the VCC and GND pins of DHT11 and AM2311 to +5V and GND pins of Arduino
        * Connect the Ethernet shield to the router
        * Make sure the router is connected to the ethernet.

 * Configure Internet-of-Thing server
    * Register an account on www.pacube.com
    * Create 5 data streams with the ids 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, which is the same as 42131.

 * Software preparation
     * Install [http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software Arduino 1.o]
     * Download the required libraries here (http://code.google.com/p/houseonline/source/browse/trunk/src/Libs/) and copy them to the folder {{{<AruinoInstallationPath>/libraries/}}}
    * Download the project sketch code http://code.google.com/p/houseonline/source/browse/trunk/src/Project/houseonline.ino

 * Modify the sketch 
    * Open the sketch in the Arduino IDE.
    * Use the actual data to replace the space holders for string macro  PACHUBE_API_KEY and numeric macro PACHUBE_FEED_ID.
    * Build the sketch

 * Upload
    * Connect the Arduino and PC with the USB cable.
    * Upload the sketch to Arduino.

 * Hardware deployment
   * Place the Arduino to the palace you want to monitor. 

*That's All!*
